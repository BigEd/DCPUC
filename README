DCPUC, A C-like language for the DCPU-16, the 16-bit 'hardware' in Mojang's game 0x10c. 

This compiler targets DCPU assembly. http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt

The output of this compiler has been tested with this emulator https://github.com/mappum/DCPU-16 and may output the 'BRK' instruction, which is a feature of that emulator and not of the official DCPU-16 spec.

There is a simple GUI compiler included (DCPUCIDE). Try compiling this program:

function fib(n) 
{
   if (n == 0) return 0;
   if (n == 1) return 1;
   return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}

var a;
a = fib(6);

Have fun, and read the language spec!
